      `My journey with technology goes back to when I was just a child. I still remember very fondly when I used to go with my dad to the university he gave classes in and admired as he swiftly dissasembled computer components.`,
      `After struggling which what career in tech to take, and stumbling from networks to server administration, I finally decided to learn programming by my own. After learning HTML (quickly, very tbh) and struggling with CSS (still do, never found anyone who doesn't!?), I started to take a grip of front-end engineering by learning JS and some of the very useful libraries like React.`,
      `What a ride it has been so far, but the noice part to it it's that it has given me the chance to learn a little of very diverse and interesting topics. I've been coding with React, Vainilla JS, Python, Bash, PHP, C#, just to name a few. But the biggest lesson: never think you are not enough (or too much of yourself), there's always room for improving`,
